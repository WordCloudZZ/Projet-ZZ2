sharing link is easier and more streamlined. SeeUsing Federated Cloud Sharingto learn to how to create and connectto new Federated Cloud shares.4.2 Accessing ownCloud Files Using WebDAVownCloud fully supports the WebDA V protocol, and you can connect and synchronize with your ownCloud 002les overWebDA V . In this chapter you will learn how to connect Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, and mobile devices to yourownCloud server via WebDA V . Before we get into con002guring WebDA V , let's take a quick look at the recommendedway of connecting client devices to your ownCloud servers.4.2.1 ownCloud Desktop and Mobile ClientsThe recommended method for keeping your desktop PC synchronized with your ownCloud server is by using theownCloud Desktop Client. Y ou can con002gure the ownCloud client to save 002les in any local directory you want, andyou choose which directories on the ownCloud server to sync with. The client displays the current connection statusand logs all activity, so you always know which remote 002les have been downloaded to your PC, and you can verifythat 002les created and updated on your local PC are properly synchronized with the server.The recommended method for syncing your ownCloud server with Android and Apple iOS devices is by using theownCloud mobile apps.To connect to your ownCloud server with theownCloudmobile apps, use the base URL and folder only:
example.org/owncloud
In addition to the mobile apps provided by ownCloud, you can use other apps to connect to ownCloud from yourmobile device using WebDA V . WebDA V Navigator is a good 050proprietary051 app for Android devices, iPhones, andBlackBerry devices. The URL to use on these is:
example.org/owncloud/remote.php/webdav
4.2.2 WebDAV Con002gurationIf you prefer, you may also connect your desktop PC to your ownCloud server by using the WebDA V protocol ratherthan using a special client application. Web Distributed Authoring and V ersioning 050WebDA V051 is a Hypertext TransferProtocol 050HTTP051 extension that makes it easy to create, read, and edit 002les on Web servers. With WebDA V you canaccess your ownCloud shares on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows in the same way as any remote network share, andstay synchronized.
Note:In the following examples, Y ou must adjustexample.org/to the URL of your ownCloud server installation.
4.2.3 Accessing Files Using LinuxY ou can access 002les in Linux operating systems using the following methods.Nautilus File ManagerUse thedavs://protocol to connect the Nautilus 002le manager to your ownCloud share:
4.2. Accessing ownCloud Files Using WebDAV	15ownCloud User Manual, Release 8.1
davs://example.org/owncloud/remote.php/webdav
Note:If your server connection is not HTTPS-secured, usedav://instead ofdavs://.
Accessing Files with KDE and Dolphin File ManagerTo access your ownCloud 002les using the Dolphin 002le manager in KDE, use thewebdav://protocol:
webdav://example.org/owncloud/remote.php/webdav
16	Chapter 4. Files & SynchronizationownCloud User Manual, Release 8.1
Y ou can create a permanent link to your ownCloud server:1. Open Dolphin and click 223Network224 in the left hand 223Places224 column.2. Click on the icon labeledAdd a Network Folder. The resulting dialog should appear with WebDA V alreadyselected.3. If WebDA V is not selected, select it.4. ClickNext.5. Enter the following settings:225 Name: The name you want to see in thePlacesbookmark, for example ownCloud.225 User: The ownCloud username you used to log in, for example admin.225 Server: The ownCloud domain name, for exampleexample.org050withouthttp://before or directoriesafterwards051.225 Folder 226 Enter the pathowncloud/remote.php/webdav.6. 050Optional051 Check the 223Create icon checkbox224 for a bookmark to appear in the Places column.7. 050Optional051 Provide any special settings or an SSL certi002cate in the 223Port & Encrypted224 checkbox.4.2.4 Creating WebDAV Mounts on the Linux Command LineY ou can create WebDA V mounts from the Linux command line. This is useful if you prefer to access ownCloud thesame way as any other remote 002lesystem mount. The following example shows how to create a personal mount andhave it mounted automatically every time you log in to your Linux computer.1. Install thedavfs2WebDA V 002lesystem driver, which allows you to mount WebDA V shares just like any otherremote 002lesystem. Use this command to install it on Debian/Ubuntu:
4.2. Accessing ownCloud Files Using WebDAV	17ownCloud User Manual, Release 8.1
apt-get install davfs2
2. Use this command to install it on CentOS, Fedora, and openSUSE:
yum install davfs2
3. Add yourself to thedavfs2group:
usermod -aG davfs2 <username>
3. Then create anownclouddirectory in your home directory for the mountpoint, and.davfs2/for yourpersonal con002guration 002le:
mkdir ~/owncloudmkdir ~/.davfs2
4. Copy/etc/davfs2/secretsto~/.davfs2:
cp	/etc/davfs2/secrets ~/.davfs2/secrets
5. Set yourself as the owner and make the permissions read-write owner only:
chown <username>:<username>	~/.davfs2/secretschmod 600 ~/.davfs2/secrets
6. Add your ownCloud login credentials to the end of thesecrets002le, using your ownCloud server URL andyour ownCloud username and password:
example.org/owncloud/remote.php/webdav <username> <password>
7. Add the mount information to/etc/fstab:
example.org/owncloud/remote.php/webdav /home/<username>/ownclouddavfs user,rw,auto 0 0
8. Then test that it mounts and authenticates by running the following command. If you set it up correctly youwon't need root permissions:
mount ~/owncloud
9. Y ou should also be able to unmount it:
umount ~/owncloud
Now every time you login to your Linux system your ownCloud share should automatically mount via WebDA V inyour~/ownclouddirectory. If you prefer to mount it manually, changeautotonoautoin/etc/fstab.4.2.5 Known IssuesProblemResource temporarily unavailableSolutionIf you experience trouble when you create a 002le in the directory, edit/etc/davfs2/davfs2.confand add:

3. ClickConnect.The device connects to the server.For added details about how to connect to an external server using Mac OS X, check the vendor documentation4.2.7 Accessing Files Using Microsoft WindowsIt is best to use a suitable WebDA V client from the WebDA V Project page .If you must use the native Windows implementation, you can map ownCloud to a new drive. Mapping to a driveenables you to browse 002les stored on an ownCloud server the way you would 002les stored in a mapped network drive.Using this feature requires network connectivity. If you want to store your 002les of003ine, use the ownCloud DesktopClient to sync all 002les on your ownCloud to one or more directories of your local hard drive.
Note:Prior to mapping your drive, you must permit the use of Basic Authentication in the Windows Registry.

Mapping Drives With the Command LineThe following example shows how to map a drive using the command line. To map the drive:1. Open a command prompt in Windows.2. Enter the following line in the command prompt to map to the computer Z drive:
net use Z: https://<drive_path>/remote.php/webdav /user:youruseryourpassword
where <drive_path> is the URL to your ownCloud server.For	example:net use Z: https://example.org/owncloud/remote.php/webdav/user:youruser yourpasswordThe computer maps the 002les of your ownCloud account to the drive letter Z.
Note:Though not recommended, you can also mount the ownCloud server using HTTP , leaving the connectionunencrypted. If you plan to use HTTP connections on devices while in a public place, we strongly recommend usinga VPN tunnel to provide the necessary security.
An alternative command syntax is:
net use Z: 134134example.org@ssl134owncloud134remote.php134webdav /user:youruseryourpassword

4.3 Managing Deleted FilesWhen you delete a 002le in ownCloud, it is not immediately deleted permanently. Instead, it is moved into the trash bin.It is not permanently deleted until you manually delete it, or when the Deleted Files app deletes it to make room fornew 002les.Find your deleted 002les by clicking on theDeleted 002lesbutton on the Files page of the ownCloud Web interface. Y ou'llhave options to either restore or permanently delete 002les.4.3.1 QuotasDeleted 002les are not counted against your storage quota. Only 002les that originate with users count against their quotas,not 002les shared with them that originate from other users. 050SeeStorage Quotato learn more about quotas.051
4.3. Managing Deleted Files	25ownCloud User Manual, Release 8.1
4.3.2 What Happens When Shared Files Are DeletedDeleting 002les gets a little complicated when they are shared 002les, as this scenario illustrates:1. User1 shares a folder 223test224 with User2 and User32. User2 050the recipient051 deletes a 002le/folder 223sub224 inside of 223test2243. The folder 223sub224 will be moved to the trashbin of both User1 050owner051 and User2 050recipient0514. But User3 will not have a copy of 223sub224 in her trash binWhen User1 deletes 223sub224 then it is moved to User1's trash bin. It is deleted from User2 and User3, but not placed intheir trash bins.When you share 002les, other users may copy, rename, move, and share them with other people, just as they can for anycomputer 002les; ownCloud does not have magic powers to prevent this.4.3.3 How the Deleted Files app Manages Storage SpaceTo ensure that users do not run over their storage quotas, the Deleted Files app allocates a maximum of 50% of theircurrently available free space to deleted 002les. If your deleted 002les exceed this limit, ownCloud deletes the oldest 002les050002les with the oldest timestamps from when they were deleted051 until it meets the memory usage limit again.ownCloud checks the age of deleted 002les every time new 002les are added to the deleted 002les.	By default,deleted 002les stay in the trash bin for 180 days.	The ownCloud server administrator can adjust this valuein theconfig.php002le by setting thetrashbin_retention_obligationvalue. Files older than thetrashbin_retention_obligationvalue will be deleted permanently. Additionally, ownCloud calculatesthe maximum available space every time a new 002le is added. If the deleted 002les exceed the new maximum allowedspace ownCloud will expire old deleted 002les until the limit is met once again.4.4 Desktop and Mobile SynchronizationFor synchronizing 002les with your desktop computer, we recommend using the ownCloud Sync Client for Windows,Mac OS X and Linux.The ownCloud Desktop Sync Client enables you to connect to your private ownCloud Server. Y ou can create foldersin your home directory, and keep the contents of those folders synced with your ownCloud server. Simply copy a 002leinto the directory and the ownCloud desktop client does the rest. Make a change to the 002les on one computer, it will003ow across the others using these desktop sync clients. Y ou will always have your latest 002les with you wherever youare.Its usage is documented separately in the ownCloud Desktop Client Manual.4.4.1 Mobile ClientsVisit your Personal page in your ownCloud Web interface to 002nd download links for Android and iOS mobile syncclients. Or, visit the ownCloud download page.Visit the ownCloud documentation page to read the mobile apps user manuals.

4.5 Encrypting Your ownCloud FilesownCloud includes an Encryption app, and when it is enabled by your ownCloud administrator all of your ownClouddata 002les are automatically encrypted. Encryption is server-wide, so when it is enabled you cannot choose to keepyour 002les unencrypted. Y ou don't have to do anything special, as it uses your ownCloud login as the password foryour unique private encryption key. Just log in and out and manage and share your 002les as you normally do, and youcan still change your password whenever you want.Its main purpose is to encrypt 002les on remote storage services that are connected to your ownCloud server, such asDropbox and Google Drive. This is an easy and seamless way to protect your 002les on remote storage. Y ou can shareyour remote 002les through ownCloud in the usual way, however you cannot share your encrypted 002les directly fromDropbox, Google Drive, or whatever remote service you are using, because the encryption keys are stored on yourownCloud server, and are never exposed to outside service providers.If your ownCloud server is not connected to any remote storage services, then it is better to use some other formof encryption such as 002le-level or whole disk encryption. Because the keys are kept on your ownCloud server, it ispossible for your ownCloud admin to snoop in your 002les, and if the server is compromised the intruder may get accessto your 002les. 050Read How ownCloud uses encryption to protect your data to learn more.0514.5.1 Using EncryptionownCloud encryption is pretty much set it and forget it, but you have a few options you can use.When your ownCloud admin enables encryption for the 002rst time, you must log out and then log back in to create yourencryption keys and encrypt your 002les. When encryption has been enabled on your ownCloud server you will see ayellow banner on your Files page warning you to log out and then log back in.
When you log back in it takes a few minutes to work, depending on how many 002les you have, and then you are returnedto your default ownCloud page.
4.5. Encrypting Your ownCloud Files	27ownCloud User Manual, Release 8.1
Note:Y ou must never lose your ownCloud password, because you will lose access to your 002les. Though there isan optional recovery option that your ownCloud administrator may enable; see the Recovery Key Password section050below051 to learn about this.
4.5.2 Sharing Encrypted FilesOnly users who have private encryption keys have access to shared encrypted 002les and folders. Users who have not yetcreated their private encryption keys will not have access to encrypted shared 002les; they will see folders and 002lenames,but will not be able to open or download the 002les. They will see a yellow warning banner that says 223Encryption Appis enabled but your keys are not initialized, please log-out and log-in again.224Share owners may need to re-share 002les after encryption is enabled; users trying to access the share will see a messageadvising them to ask the share owner to re-share the 002le with them. For individual shares, un-share and re-share the002le. For group shares, share with any individuals who can't access the share. This updates the encryption, and thenthe share owner can remove the individual shares.Recovery Key PasswordIf your ownCloud administrator has enabled the recovery key feature, you can choose to use this feature for youraccount. If you enable 223Password recovery224 the administrator can read your data with a special password. This featureenables the administrator to recover your 002les in the event you lose your ownCloud password. If the recovery key isnot enabled, then there is no way to restore your 002les if you lose your login password.
4.5.3 Files Not EncryptedOnly the data in your 002les is encrypted, and not the 002lenames or folder structures. These 002les are never encrypted:225 Old 002les in the trash bin.225 Image thumbnails from the Gallery app.225 Previews from the Files app.225 The search index from the full text search app.225 Third-party app data
28	Chapter 4. Files & SynchronizationownCloud User Manual, Release 8.1
There may be other 002les that are not encrypted; only 002les that are exposed to third-party storage providers are guaran-teed to be encrypted.Change Private Key PasswordThis option is only available if your log-in password, but not your encryption password, was changed by your admin-istrator. This can occur if your ownCloud provider uses a external user back-end 050for example, LDAP051 and changedyour login password using that back-end con002guration. In this case, you can set your encryption password to your newlogin password by providing your old and new login password. The Encryption app works only if your login passwordand your encryption password are identical.4.6 Using Federated Cloud SharingFederated Cloud Sharing, introduced in ownCloud 7 as Server-to-Server sharing, allows you to mount 002le shares fromremote ownCloud servers, in effect creating your own cloud of ownClouds. Y ou can create direct share links withusers on other ownCloud servers.4.6.1 Creating a New Federated Cloud ShareFederated Cloud Sharing is enabled on new or upgraded ownCloud installations by default. 050See 223Con002guring Feder-ated Cloud Sharing224 in the ownCloud Server Administration Manual.051 Follow these steps to create a new share:1. Go to yourFilespage and click the Share icon on the 002le or directory you want to share. Enter the user-name and URL of the remote user in this form:<username>@<oc-server-url>. In this example, that islayla@remote-server/owncloud. The form automatically echoes the address that you type and labels it as223remote224.
2. Y ou'll see a status indicator as ownCloud looks for the remote server.When your local ownCloud server makes a successful connection with the remote ownCloud server you'll see acon002rmation.Y our recipient on the other end of the link, on the remote ownCloud server, will see a dialog asking them to con002rmthe new share. All they have to do is click theAdd remote sharebutton, and it's done.Click the Share button anytime to see who you have shared your 002le with. Remove your linked share anytime byclicking the trash can icon. This only unlinks the share, and does not delete any 002les.

4.6.2 Creating a New Federated Cloud Share via EmailWhat if you do not know the username or URL? Then you can have ownCloud create the link for you and email it toyour recipient.
When your recipient receives your email they will have to take a number of steps to complete the share link. First theymust open the link you sent them in a Web browser, and then click theAdd to your ownCloudbutton.
TheAdd to your ownCloudbutton changes to a form 002eld, and your recipient needs to enter the URL of theirownCloud server in this 002eld and press the return key, or click the arrow.Next, they will see a dialog asking to con002rm. All they have to do is click theAdd remote sharebutton and they're002nished.Remove your linked share anytime by clicking the trash can icon. This only unlinks the share, and does not delete any002les.

4.7 Making Anonymous Uploads 050ES Only051If your ownCloud administrator 050Enterprise Subscription only051 has enabled the Files Drop application, you may createyour own special upload directory so that other people can upload 002les to you without having to log in to the server,and without being an ownCloud user. They will not be allowed to see the contents of this directory, or to makeany changes. This is an excellent alternative to sending large attachments via email, using an FTP server, or usingcommercial 002le-sharing services.4.7.1 Setting Up Your Own File DropGo to your Personal page and you will see the Files Drop con002guration section.
Click theChoosebutton to open a dialog to select your upload directory. Y ou may wish to 002rst create a special uploaddirectory 050on your Files page051, which in the following example is nameupload.
Figure 4.6:Click to enlarge
32	Chapter 4. Files & SynchronizationownCloud User Manual, Release 8.1
On your Personal page you should now see a URL for your upload directory. Share this URL with anyone you wantto allow uploads to your Files Drop folder. Note that the default maximum upload size in this example is 512MB; thisis con002gurable, so contact your ownCloud administrator if you need a larger limit.
4.7.2 Uploading FilesUsing the Files Drop app is simple. Y ou receive a link to the upload folder, click the link, and then you'll see anownCloud page with aClick to uploadbutton.
Figure 4.7:Click to enlargeThis opens a 002le picker, and you select the 002le or directory you want to upload.When your upload is completed, you'll see a con002rmation message with the 002lenames.4.8 Large File UploadsWhen uploading 002les through the web client, ownCloud is limited by PHP and Apache con002gurations. By default,PHP is con002gured for only 2 megabyte uploads. As this default upload limit is not entirely useful, we recommend thatyour ownCloud admin increase the ownCloud variables to sizes appropriate for users.Modifying certain ownCloud variables requires administrative access. If you require larger upload limits than havebeen provided by the default 050or already set by your administrator051:225 Contact your administrator to request an increase in these variables225 Refer to the section in the Admin Documentation that describes how to manage 002le upload size limits.

4.9 Storage QuotaY our ownCloud admin has the option to set a storage quota on users. Look at the top of your Personal page to seewhat your quota is, and how much you have used.
It may be helpful to understand how your quota is calculated.Metadata 050thumbnails, temporary 002les, cache, and encryption keys051 takes up about 10% of disk space, but is notcounted against user quotas. Some apps store information in the database, such as the Calendar and Contacts apps.This data is excluded from your quota.When other users share 002les with you, the shared 002les count against the original share owner's quota. When you sharea folder and allow other users or groups to upload 002les to it, all uploaded and edited 002les count against your quota.When you re-share 002les shared with you, the re-share still counts against the quota of the original share owner.Encrypted 002les are a little larger than unencrypted 002les; the unencrypted size is calculated against your quota.Deleted 002les that are still in the trash bin do not count against quotas. The trash bin is set at 50% of quota. Deleted002le aging is set at 30 days. When deleted 002les exceed 50% of quota then the oldest 002les are removed until the total isbelow 50%.When version control is enabled, the older 002le versions are not counted against quotas.If you create a public share via URL, and allow uploads, any uploaded 002les count against your quota.4.10 Version ControlownCloud supports simple version control system for 002les. V ersioning creates backups of 002les which are accessiblevia the V ersions link. This link contains the history of the 002le where you can roll back a 002le to any previous version.Changes made at intervals greater than two minutes are saved in data/[user]/versions.To restore a speci002c version of a 002le, hover your cursor over a 002le and click theV ersionslink. If any version isavailable, you should see a list like the image below:
Clicking onRestorenext to any version will revert the 002le to that version back.The versioning app expires old versions automatically to make sure that the user doesn't run out of space. This patternis used to delete old versions:225 For the 002rst second we keep one version225 For the 002rst 10 seconds ownCloud keeps one version every 2 seconds

If the stored versions exceedthis limit, ownCloud deletes the oldest versions until it meets the disk space limit again.

Figure 5.5:Contact picture 050default051When you specify the name of a contact, the avatar re003ects the name by adopting the 002rst letter of the name youprovide. For example, if you were to specify the name of 223Frederick,224 the avatar would dynamically change to 223F224 forthat contact. If you provide multiple contacts with the same name, or with names that start with the same 002rst letter,the avatar uses the same letter but changes color to indicate the difference.

For OS X 10.7 Lion and 10.8 Mountain Lion everything works 002ne, but OS X 10.6 050SnowLeopard051 and older needs some 002ddling to work. A user contributed the following:1. Make sure, addressbook is not running. If it is, select the windows and press Command + Q to terminate it.2. Navigate to/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Application Support/AddressBook/Sources. If you haveall ready some kind of addressbook setup, it is likely you will see some folders named like thisBEA92826-FBF3-4E53-B5C6-ED7C2B454430. Note down what folders there are now and leave the window open.3. Open addressbook and try to add a new CardDav addressbook. At this point, it does not matter what informationyou enter. It will come up with the same error message you mentioned before when you click 223Create224. Ignoreit and click 223Create224 again. A non-functional addressbook will be added.4. Close addressbook again using Command + Q5. Go back to the folder window from step 2. Y ou will now see a newly created folder with another long string asits name.6. Navigate to the newly created folder and edit theCon002guration.plistwith your favorite text editor.7. Search for a section looking like this:
<key>servername</key> <string>http://:0050null051</string> <key>username</key> <string>Whatever_you_entered_before</string>
8. Make it look like this. Please note that the :80 afterYOUR_DOMAINis important:
<key>servername</key <string>http://YOUR_DOMAIN:80/owncloud/remote.php/carddav/principals/username</string> <key>username</key <string>username</string>
9. Save the 002le and open addressbook again. It will not work yet.10. Open the preferences for your ownCloud CardDA V-Account and enter your password.11. Y ou may have to restart addressbook once more. After this, it should work.If it's still not working, have a look at theTroubleshootingand Troubleshooting Contacts & Calendar guides.There is also an easy HOWTO in the forum.
